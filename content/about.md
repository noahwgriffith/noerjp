Most guides about how to learn a language are either too complicated, or give poor advice (sorry!). So I wanted to write my own to keep things simple for new learners. More detailed guides are useful, but in my experience getting a new person into immersion is already overwhelming. The added stress of terminology (i+1? Comprehensible input? Beuller? Beuller?), anki settings, passive:listening:reading:active ratios, and fighting over methodology tends to instantly turn people off.

(Don't get me wrong, those conversations are interesting and useful. They're just overwhelming for someone who barely knows 20 words in their target language.)

So this guide for those absolute beginners. If you already understand immersion learning, the other resources in [my linktree](https://linktr.ee/noerjp) will be more useful to you.
