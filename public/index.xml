      <description>You want to learn Japanese (or another language). This website is about how to do that effectively.

Who is this for? Friends have asked me how to learn a language. Hi Kyle. Hi Jack. I wanted to put a concise explanation online so people can read it.</description>

      <description>Most guides about how to learn a language are either too complicated, or give poor advice (sorry!). So I wanted to write my own to keep things simple for new learners. More detailed guides are useful, but in my experience getting a new person into immersion is already overwhelming. The added stress of terminology (i+1? Comprehensible input? Beuller? Beuller?), anki settings, passive:listening:reading:active ratios, and fighting over methodology tends to instantly turn people off.</description>
