      <description>You want to learn Japanese (or another language). This website is about how to do that effectively.
This website is not a detailed explanation about why that works. (Though there will be some explanation.) For more detail about the point of this website see about.
Who is this for? Friends have asked me how to learn a language. Hi Kyle. Hi Jack. I wanted to put a concise explanation online so people can read it.</description>

      <description>Dedicated to Jack This post is dedicated to my friend Jack. I may never be able to convince you of immersion learning, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. It&amp;rsquo;s good blog fuel. This post is basically a letter to him. Taking his main problems with the method as a jumping off point, I am setting out to convince him. My goal is to get him to incorporate immersion.

      <description>Confusion There often seems to be confusion about what is meant by immersion. Most people assume it has something to do with living in the country in which your target language is spoken. They assume they need to plan a trip to this country and, after having learned the basics at home, they will magically develop fluency just by being on that country&amp;rsquo;s soil.
Well the good news is that none of that is quite accurate.</description>

      <description>Most guides about how to learn a language are either too complicated, or give poor advice (sorry!). So I wanted to write my own to keep things simple for new learners. More detailed guides are useful, but in my experience getting a new person into immersion is already overwhelming. The added stress of terminology (i+1? Comprehensible input? Beuller? Beuller?), anki settings, passive:listening:reading:active ratios, and fighting over methodology tends to instantly turn people off.</description>
